It will get you quickly set up to use Rocketeer.\r\n\r\nThe available commands in Rocketeer are :\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeploy\r\n\tdeploy:setup               Set up the website for deployment\r\n\tdeploy:deploy              Deploy the website.\r\n\tdeploy:cleanup             Clean up old releases from the server\r\n\tdeploy:current             Displays what the current release is\r\n\tdeploy:rollback {release}  Rollback to a specific release\r\n\tdeploy:rollback            Rollback to the previous release\r\n\tdeploy:teardown            Removes the remote applications and existing caches\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\nAn important concept in Rocketeer is Tasks : most of the commands you see right above are using predefined Tasks underneath : **Rocketeer\\Tasks\\Setup**, **Rocketeer\\Tasks\\Deploy**, etc.\r\nNow, the core of Rocketeer is you can hook into any of those Tasks to peform additional actions, for this you'll use the `before` and `after` arrays of Rocketeer's config file.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Tasks and what you can do with them [in the wiki](https://github.com/Anahkiasen/rocketeer/wiki/Tasks).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
